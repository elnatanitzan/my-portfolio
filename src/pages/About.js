                        I am Front-End junior web developer.
                        I can provide clean code and pixel perfect design.
                        I just recently completed a Full-Stack development course, and despite that I especially like to develop a client-side.
                        I am currently looking for my first job in development.
                        In my portfolio you can take a look at some of my projects.
